## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned to effectively utilize semantic HTML5 elements to improve the accessibility and structure of the web page. I also refined my skills in CSS custom properties, Flexbox for responsive design. Here are some code snippets that I am proud of:

#### HTML

```html
<h1>Simple Omelette Recipe</h1>
```
### CSS

```css
h1 {
   color: var(--Dark-Charcoal);
}
```
### JS

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I plan to focus on:

- Improving my JavaScript skills, particularly with modern frameworks like React.
- Enhancing my understanding of responsive design techniques.
- Exploring more advanced CSS properties and animations.

### Useful Resources
